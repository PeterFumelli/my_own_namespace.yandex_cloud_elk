bugfixes:
  - task timeout - Specifying a negative task timeout now results in an error.
  - error handling - Error details and tracebacks from connection and built-in action exceptions are preserved.
    Previously, much of the detail was lost or mixed into the error message.

minor_changes:
  - task timeout - Specifying a timeout greater than 100,000,000 now results in an error.
