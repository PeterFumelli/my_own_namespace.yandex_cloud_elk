minor_changes:
- ssh-agent - ``ansible``, ``ansible-playbook`` and ``ansible-console`` are capable of spawning or reusing an ssh-agent,
  allowing plugins to interact with the ssh-agent.
  Additionally a pure python ssh-agent client has been added, enabling easy interaction with the agent. The ssh connection plugin contains
  new functionality via ``ansible_ssh_private_key`` and ``ansible_ssh_private_key_passphrase``, for loading an SSH private key into
  the agent from a variable.
