minor_changes:
  - templating - Switched from the Jinja immutable sandbox to the standard sandbox.
    This restores the ability to use mutation methods such as ``list.append`` and ``dict.update``.
  - templating - Relaxed the Jinja sandbox to allow specific bitwise operations which have no filter equivalent.
    The allowed methods are ``__and__``, ``__lshift__``, ``__or__``, ``__rshift__``, ``__xor__``.
